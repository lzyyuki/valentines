    <div class="message">
      Dear Roxanne / Lovey 🎀,
      <br><br>
      This is my little letter for you.  
      I know I said I’m still healing, and that’s true. But I also know this: you came into my life at a time when I was close to hitting rock bottom, and somehow you pulled me back without even trying. Just by being you.
I won’t lie, I already think you’re beautiful, but what makes me want to stay is everything beyond that. The way you speak, the way you listen, the way you’re soft in a world that hasn’t always been gentle with you. I want to know you more, not just the parts you’re confident in, but also the parts you keep quiet.
And honestly, I really appreciate you. I talk a lot, I yap a lot, and all I ever needed was someone who actually listens. You do. You don’t just hear me, you let me be myself, and that matters more to me than you probably realize.
I usually want my actions to be flawless. I think a lot before I move, and I try my best not to hurt people I care about. But I’m still human. I can make mistakes, and if I do, I won’t run from them. I’ll own them and fix them.
I also want you to know this, because I feel like you might overthink it sometimes. You never need to worry that I’m getting bored of you. You being quiet, soft, or not talking much doesn’t push me away. If anything, I’m the one who talks too much anyway. Your silence isn’t empty to me. It’s comfortable.
About your insecurities, especially the ones about how you look, I want to be clear. I don’t love you despite them. I love every part of you, even the parts you don’t like yet. The things you think make you less don’t make me step back. They make me want to be gentler and more patient with you.
We started saying I love you earlier than people usually expect. But love doesn’t follow a schedule. It doesn’t wait for months or labels. It just happens, and it did.
I’m serious about you. I’m not here to play, and I’m not here just for the easy days. I want to be here even when things feel heavy, even when you doubt yourself, even when you’re quiet. I want to court you properly and hopefully soon call you mine. 💌<br><br>
      — Your yuki lablab 🫶
